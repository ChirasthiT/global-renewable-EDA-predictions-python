The Global Renewable Energy and Indicators Dataset is a comprehensive resource designed for in-depth analysis and research in the field of renewable energy. This dataset includes detailed information on renewable energy production, socio-economic factors, and environmental indicators from around the world. Key features include:

1.Renewable Energy Data: Covers various types of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal energy, detailing their production (in GWh), installed capacity (in MW), and investments (in USD) across different countries and years.

2.Socio-Economic Indicators: Includes data on population, GDP, energy consumption, energy exports and imports, CO2 emissions, renewable energy jobs, government policies, R&D expenditure, and renewable energy targets.

3.Environmental Factors: Provides information on average annual temperature, annual rainfall, solar irradiance, wind speed, hydro potential, geothermal potential, and biomass availability.

4.Additional Features: Contains relevant features such as energy storage capacity, grid integration capability, electricity prices, energy subsidies, international aid for renewables, public awareness scores, energy efficiency programs, urbanization rate, industrialization rate, energy market liberalization, renewable energy patents, educational level, technology transfer agreements, renewable energy education programs, local manufacturing capacity, import tariffs, export incentives, natural disasters, political stability, corruption perception index, regulatory quality, rule of law, control of corruption, economic freedom index, ease of doing business, innovation index, number of research institutions, renewable energy conferences, renewable energy publications, energy sector workforce, proportion of energy from renewables, public-private partnerships, and regional renewable energy cooperation.
